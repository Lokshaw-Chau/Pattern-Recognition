# Pattern Recognition

This repository contains my answers for assignments of *Pattern Recognition*

> *Pattern recognition* is the scientific discipline whose goal is the classification of objects into a number of categories or classes.

This class mainly provides methods of classic mechine learning and an introduction to deep learing.

## Assignments 1

This assignment is mainly about classification methods based on distance, clusting algorithms and the related indices to judge the results of these algorithms. Indices and algorithms included are listed as followed:

* **Algorithms:** Nearest-neighbor Classification, Template Matching, Sequential Clustering, K-means, Hierachical Clustering.

* **Indices:** Dunn indice, Davies_Bouldin indice

## Assignment 2

This assignment mainly explores the topic of linear classification machanism, feature selection and feature dimension reduction, non-linear classification machanism. Algorithms included are listed as followed:

* **Algorithms:**Proceptron, Principle component analysis, Fisher discriminant analysis, Supported vector mechine
